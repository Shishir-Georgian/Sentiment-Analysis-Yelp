##  Project Overview
This project aims to extract sentiment polarity from real Yelp customer reviews. Using the VADER sentiment analyzer along with TF-IDF vectorization and a Naive Bayes classifier, we built a complete machine learning pipeline. Class imbalance was handled using SMOTE. The final model was evaluated using accuracy scores, confusion matrix, and word cloud visualizations.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- NLTK (VADER)
- Scikit-learn
- Imblearn (SMOTE)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- WordCloud
